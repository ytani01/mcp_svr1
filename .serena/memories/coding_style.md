# Coding Style and Conventions

- **Language:** All chat and comments in the source code should be in Japanese.
- **Line Length:** Each line of code should not exceed 78 characters.
- **Logging:** Use the `get_logger()` function from `my_logger.py` for any debug logging.
- **Immutability:** Do not modify `my_logger.py`.
- **Linting and Type Checking:** The project uses `ruff`, `mypy`, and `pyright` for static analysis. Ensure your code passes all checks before proposing a commit.
