# Coding Style and Conventions

- Chat in Japanese.
- Research thoroughly before experimenting.
- `git commit` is user-only; propose concise, one-line English commit messages.
- Project configuration and management via `uv` and `pyproject.toml`.
- Always follow the latest `uv` specifications.
- Use `uv run ...` for command execution; no explicit `venv` activation.
- Install/add libraries with `uv add ...`; do not use `pip install ...`.
- Source code comments in Japanese.
- Max 78 characters per line.
- Use `my_logger.py`'s `get_logger()` for debug logs; `my_logger.py` should not be modified.
- Prioritize official documentation.
- Verify all assumptions.
- Systematic problem isolation.
- Utilize detailed logging.
- Respect user feedback.
- `ToDo.md` is user-managed.
- `Tasks.md` is AI-managed, in Japanese.
- Before starting work, check for `ToDo.md` and `Tasks.md`.
- If `Tasks.md` exists, execute unchecked tasks sequentially. Mark tasks as `[x]` upon completion.
- If `Tasks.md` does not exist, create it from the first unchecked item in `ToDo.md`.
- Always ask for user confirmation before starting tasks in `Tasks.md`.
- If all `Tasks.md` items are complete, report to the user, prompt user to update `ToDo.md`, and run `uv run rename_task.py`.
